The Brent–Kung adder is a parallel prefix adder (PPA) form of carry-lookahead adder (CLA). Proposed by Richard Peirce Brent and Hsiang Te Kung in 1982 it introduced higher regularity to the adder structure and has less wiring congestion leading to better performance and less necessary chip area to implement compared to the Kogge–Stone adder (KSA). It is also much quicker than ripple-carry adders (RCA).
Ripple-carry adders were the initial multi-bit adders which were developed in the early days and got their name from the ripple effect which the carry made while being propagated from right to left. The time taken for addition was directly proportional to the length of the bit being added. This is reverse in Brent–Kung adders where the carry is calculated in parallel thus reducing the addition time drastically. Further work has been done on Brent–Kung adders and other parallel adders to reduce the power consumption and chip area as well as to increase the speed thus making them suitable for low-power designs.
A Brent–Kung adder is a parallel adder made in a regular layout with an aim of minimizing the chip area and ease of manufacturing. The addition of n-bit number can be performed in time O(logn)with a chip size of area O(nlogn) thus making it a good-choice adder with constraints on area and maximizing the performance. Its symmetry and regular build structure reduces costs of production effectively and enable it to be used in pipeline architectures. In parallel adders the critical path is decided by computation of the carry from least significant bit (LSB) adder to the most significant bit (MSB) adder, therefore efforts are in reducing the critical path for the carry to reach the MSB.
